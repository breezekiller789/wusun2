Last month, CNN Supercharged presenter Nicki Shields had the chance to drive the futuristic car around the Sanya track.
The unusual asymmetric, three-seat vehicle has been designed with two different engines, one for race tracks and one for road use.
When on the road, driverless mode can be selected and and the passenger can sit inside the car's cosy-looking 'cocoon,' while drivers on the race track are exposed to the elements.
The car's suspension has been engineered by DS Performance -- the technical team behind the manufacturer's Formula E programme -- while the vehicle body is "capable of recovering its original form after an impact," according to DS Automobiles.
Former world champion Lucas Di Grassi celebrates his victory at the Mexico ePrix, arguably the most thrilling race in the sport&#39;s five seasons. Race leader Pascal Wehrlein&#39;s battery died just meters from the line, allowing Di Grassi to swoop past on the inside and snatch victory.
